# Portfolio Website
## What is this?
This is my website for my personal portfolio. Created it as a place to host personal projects, and as a tool to show myself to potential employers.

## What is this made with?
- Typescript - Superset of Javascript that adds type support among other things. I picked up TypeScript to aid my development experience
- React - Javascript framework for building UIs and websites.
- Gatsby - React framework that specializes in static site generation. Allows me to construct fast websites, and improves SEO
- TailwindCSS - CSS library that provides hundreds of utility classes for fast, easy CSS
- Netlify - Hosting service
